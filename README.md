# Recursion and Dynamic Programing

### Questions for the exercise

## Q1 -

Merge the two sorted linked lists linked_list1 and linked_list2 into a single sorted list. Create the merged list by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the resulting merged linked list.

The input will be linked_list1 = [1,2,4] and linked_list2 = [1,3,4], and the expected output is [1,1,2,3,4,4].

---

## Q2 -

Reverse the given singly linked list by manipulating its head and return the reversed list. The input is head = [1,2,3,4,5] and the expected output is [5,4,3,2,1].

---

## Q3 -

How can we remove nodes with a specific value from a linked list, and what should be returned as the new head of the modified list? The given linked list has a head node [1,2,6,3,4,5,6] and the specified value is 6. The expected output is a modified list with nodes [1,2,3,4,5].

---

## Q4 -

Solve the problem without changing the values in the nodes. Note that only the positions of the nodes can be changed, for example, if the input linked list is [1, 2, 3, 4], the output should be [2, 1, 4, 3].
